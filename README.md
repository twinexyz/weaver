### Pre-commit hooks
This repository makes use of `pre-commit` hooks. There are two methods of setting it up:
1. **Recommended**: A pre-downloaded artifact is provided in `artifacts/pre-commit.pyz` (originally `artifacts/pre-commit-x.y.z.pyz` and dowloaded from: [https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/releases](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/releases))
2. **Optional**: Install using steps mentioned here: [https://pre-commit.com/](https://pre-commit.com/). This makes sure "pre-commit" is run every time before you try doing a `git commit`. Useful for implicit invocation.

#### Explicit invocation of hooks without `git commit`
Before every git commit, it should be ensured that following is run locally for everyone's sanity.
```
./artifacts/pre-commit.pyz run --all-files
```
